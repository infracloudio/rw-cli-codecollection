### How to test this codebundle? 

## Prerequisites

The following credentials and configuration are required:

- Jenkins URL
- Jenkins username 
- Jenkins API token

## Configuration

**Infrastructure Deployment**

Purpose: Cloud infrastructure provisioning and management using Terraform

#### Credential Setup

Navigate to the `.test/terraform` directory and configure two secret files for authentication:

`cb.secret` - CloudCustodian and RunWhen Credentials

Create this file with the following environment variables:

	```sh
	export RW_PAT=""
	export RW_WORKSPACE=""
	export RW_API_URL="papi.beta.runwhen.com"

    export JENKINS_URL=""
	export JENKINS_USERNAME=""
	export JENKINS_TOKEN=""
	```


`tf.secret` - Terraform Deployment Credentials

Create this file with the following environment variables:

	```sh
	export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
	export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
	export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
	export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="" # Optional: Include if using temporary credentials
	```

####  Testing Workflow

1. Build test infra:
	```sh
		task build-infra
	```	

2. Generate RunWhen Configurations
	```sh
		tasks
	```

3. Upload generated SLx to RunWhen Platform

	```sh
		task upload-slxs
	```

4. At last, after testing, clean up the test infrastructure.

```sh
	task clean
```
